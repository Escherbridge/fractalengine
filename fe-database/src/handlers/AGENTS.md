# Database handlers

## Node measurement projections

The desktop's `ReadNodeMeasurements` command uses `node_measurements.rs`, rather than user-authored
RawQuery. It resolves stored ancestry and requires Viewer access at database use. Both series and
point queries bind node, Petal, Fractal and Verse and require the node's current Petal membership.
A post-read ancestry/role check rejects intervening changes. Node, metric and units distinguish the
series; event timestamp and reading ID determine order. Shared runtime limits cap the series catalog
at 64 and points at 1,024, with explicit truncation flags. Units are never merged into one plotted
series. This is a local persisted projection; it does not claim distributed completeness,
missing-shard coverage, or a historical object anchor.
